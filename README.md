### Country with the most and the lowest coffee intake 
The country with the lowest coffee intake is Germany and the country with the highest coffee intake is Brazil. The lowest coffee intake is associated with Germany, as seen by the minimum value in 'Coffee_Intake' column being 1 (row with index 1). The highest coffee intake is associated with Brazil, as seen by the maximum value in 'Coffee_Intake' column being 5.3 (row with index 2)
### The average of coffee intake, by age group
The average coffee intake classified by age groups is as follows: For age group '<18': 2.55. For age group '18-25': 2.56. For age group '26-60': 2.49. For age group '>60': 2.45.These values are rounded to two decimal places

### Analytic Statistic
Based on the scatter plot analysis of age versus coffee intake, there appears to be a positive correlation. This suggests that, in this dataset, as individuals age, their coffee consumption tends to increase. However, there is also variability in the data, indicating that while a trend exists, it is not absolute for every individual. Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between age and coffee intake in this dataset. As age increases, coffee consumption tends to increase as well, though individual variations exist

Based on the scatter plot matrix and box plots generated from the data
Heart Rate: There is a positive correlation between both coffee intake and caffeine mg intake with heart rate. Males generally show slightly higher heart rates compared to females at similar levels of consumption.
Sleep Hours: Caffeine mg intake shows a negative correlation with sleep hours, indicating that higher caffeine intake is associated with less sleep. This trend is consistent across genders.
Sleep Quality: There appears to be a negative relationship between caffeine mg intake and sleep quality, suggesting poorer sleep quality with increased caffeine consumption. This effect is seen in both genders, though the scatter plot matrix shows some variation.
Stress Level: Both coffee intake and caffeine mg intake display a positive correlation with stress levels. Females might exhibit slightly higher stress levels in response to caffeine intake compared to males.

The relationship between coffee intake and health outcomes is complex and influenced by several other variables in the dataset.
BMI: Shows varying correlations based on health issues, with potential for higher BMIs among those consuming more coffee and having mild health issues.
Physical Activity: Suggests a negative correlation for those without health issues, indicating less activity with higher coffee consumption.
Smoking: No clear pattern observed, suggesting smoking habit is not strongly influenced by coffee intake.
Alcohol Consumption: A positive correlation appears among non-health-issue individuals, hinting at a potential association between higher coffee intake and increased alcohol consumption in this group

## Conclusion
The country with the lowest coffee intake is Germany and the country with the highest coffee intake is Brazil.
The highest coffee intake by age is in the age group '18-25' y.o.: with average 2.56
There is a positive correlation between age and coffee intake in this dataset. As age increases, coffee consumption tends to increase as well, though individual variations exist. Higher coffee and caffeine intake seem to be associated with increased heart rate, reduced sleep duration, lower sleep quality, and heightened stress levels 
Physical activity and alcohol consumption might be the cofounding variable because correlation appear with coffee intake and health issue
